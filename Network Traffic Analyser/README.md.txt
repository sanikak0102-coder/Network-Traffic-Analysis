# Network Traffic Analysis

## Objective
To capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark and understand different protocols and communication patterns.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Windows OS

## Steps Performed
1. Captured live network traffic.
2. Saved capture as PCAP file.
3. Analyzed protocol hierarchy.
4. Observed IP conversations.
5. Filtered HTTP traffic.

## Files Included
- captures/traffic.pcapng – Network capture file
- screenshots/ – Analysis screenshots

## Key Observations
- Identified TCP, UDP, and HTTP traffic.
- Observed source and destination IP addresses.
- Analyzed packet flow.

## Conclusion
This project helped understand how network packets travel and how Wireshark can be used for basic network forensics and monitoring.
